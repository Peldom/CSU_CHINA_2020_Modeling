# CSU_CHINA_2020_Modeling
This is the iGEM team project model of CSU_CHINA_2020
## Introducing Absorption Model 
Integrated with physical simulation, we extended model level beyond biochemical reactions. Our team constructed a program using C# that simulate how cadmium, calcium alginate microcapsule, PCC6803 cells interact on each other over a series of time steps. Solid data produced by the program allowed accurate visualization of the diffusion process in COMSOL. The model allowed us to observe the activities inside of the microcapsule without time-consuming wet experiments and optimize parameters.
## Introducing Safety Model. 
The effectiveness of our *Suicide Gene System* to kill detached cells from our device is proven through this model. Implemented with DDE(delay differential equations) describing the delays in genetic expression and SDE（stochastic differential equation） describing the expression noise, our model firmly proved our system’s ability to maintain the sustainability of regular cells and erase detached cells as expected.
