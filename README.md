# CSU_CHINA_2020_Modeling
This is the iGEM team project model of CSU_CHINA_2020
Introducing Absorption Model. 
Integrated with physical simulation, we extended model level beyond biochemical reactions. Our team constructed a program using C# that simulate how cadmium, calcium alginate microcapsule, PCC6803 cells interact on each other over a series of time steps. Solid data produced by the program allowed accurate visualization of the diffusion process in COMSOL. The model allowed us to observe the activities inside of the microcapsule without time-consuming wet experiments and optimize parameters.
